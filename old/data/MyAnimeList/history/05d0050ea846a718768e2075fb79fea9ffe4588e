            "synopsis": "In the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and a massive online role-playing game called Sword Art Online (SAO) is launched. With the aid of &quot;NerveGear&quot; technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nKazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed &quot;Kirito,&quot; is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game&#039;s creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, his peace is short-lived as a new incident occurs in a game called Gun Gale Online, where a player by the name of Death Gun appears to be killing people in the real world by shooting them in-game. Approached by officials to assist in investigating the murders, Kazuto assumes his persona of Kirito once again and logs into Gun Gale Online, intent on stopping the killer.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOnce inside, Kirito meets Sinon, a highly skilled sniper afflicted by a traumatic past. She is soon dragged in his chase after Death Gun, and together they enter the Bullet of Bullets, a tournament where their target is sure to appear. Uncertain of Death Gun&#039;s real powers, Kirito and Sinon race to stop him before he has the chance to claim another life. Not everything goes smoothly, however, as scars from the past impede their progress. In a high-stakes game where the next victim could easily be one of them, Kirito puts his life on the line in the virtual world once more.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It was the first full-dive system, and with it, came endless possibilities to VRMMORPGs.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn 2026, a new machine called the Augma is developed to compete against the NerveGear and its successor, the Amusphere. A next-gen wearable device, the Augma doesn&#039;t have a full-dive function like its predecessors. Instead, it uses Augmented Reality (AR) to get players into the game. It is safe, user-friendly and lets users play while they are conscious, making it an instant hit on the market. The most popular game on the system is &quot;Ordinal Scale&quot; (aka: OS), an ARMMORPG developed exclusively for the Augma.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAsuna and the gang have already been playing OS for a while, by the time Kirito decides to join them. They&#039;re about to find out that Ordinal Scale isn&#039;t all fun and games...<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Source: Aniplex USA)",
